# Customised LinkTree

After seeign people post their links together with LinkTree, I decided to make a custom LinkTree for myself with only HTML and TailwindCSS.

# Project Overview

<p> Below is a view of the project, and a link to the site. Hover over the avatar and buttons to see some animations I added with Rough Notation. Check the live site: </p>

- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (for the animation library)

# Do you want to contribute?

- Navigate to `public` folder, and make changes to `sandbox.js` if you want to check out the animations file or `index.html` if you want to work on the main file.
