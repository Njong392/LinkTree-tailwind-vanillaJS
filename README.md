# Customised LinkTree

After seeign people post their links together with LinkTree, I decided to make a custom LinkTree for myself with only HTML and TailwindCSS.

# Project Overview

<p> Below is a view of the project, and a link to the site. Hover over the avatar and buttons to see some animations I added with Rough Notation. Check the live site: https://link-tree-tailwind-vanilla-js.vercel.app/ </p>
